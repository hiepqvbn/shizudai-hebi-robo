## Simulation class: 
 -encapsulate the entire simulation process
 - This class can bring together the different components and handle the overall simulation loop, updating the positions and states of the objects, performing collision checks, applying control inputs, and managing the simulation time step.

## Enviroment class:
 - represent 3D space
 - Robot arm, Camera,... (physical objects) will be place in Enviroment
