## Introduction

Provide an introduction to your project. Explain what it does, its main features, and any other relevant information.

## Installation

Provide instructions on how to install and set up your project. Include any prerequisites or dependencies required.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git

# Change into the project directory
cd your-repo

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Modules

The project consists of the following modules:

- **simulation**: This module contains the `simulation_code.py` file that implements the simulation logic.

- **data_collection**: This module is responsible for collecting data both from the robot and the simulation environment. It contains the `data_collection.py` file, which provides functions and classes to gather and store data from various sources.

- **model_training**: This module contains the `model.py` file that defines the model architecture, and the `train.py` file that handles training the model.

- **robot_control**: This module is further divided into sub-modules:
  - **computer_vision**: This sub-module contains the `vision_code.py` file responsible for computer vision tasks.
  - **controller**: This sub-module contains the `controller_code.py` file that implements the robot controller logic.
  - **model_integration**: This sub-module contains the `integrate_model.py` file that integrates the trained model with the robot control system.

- **validation_testing**: This module is further divided into sub-modules:
  - **simulated_environment**: This sub-module contains the `test_simulation.py` file for testing the robot in a simulated environment.
  - **real_world_environment**: This sub-module contains the `test_real_world.py` file for testing the robot in a real-world environment.

- **documentation**: This module contains project documentation files such as `project_report.pdf` and `model_documentation.pdf`. It also has a sub-directory `code_documentation` where you can include your code documentation files.

- **data**: This module is further divided into sub-modules:
  - **simulation_data**: This sub-module stores the simulation data files.
  - **robot_data**: This sub-module stores the collected robot data files.

- **models**: This module stores the trained model file `trained_model.pth`.

In addition to these modules, the project also includes the following files:
- `requirements.txt`: This file lists the required dependencies for running the project.
- `README.md`: This file contains information about the project, its structure, and instructions for running it.

Feel free to modify and customize the project structure and modules according to your specific requirements.
